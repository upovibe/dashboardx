# Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite

Welcome to your new Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite project! This template is designed to help you get started with Vue 3, TypeScript, and Vite for building modern web applications. It utilizes Vue 3's `<script setup>` syntax for Single File Components (SFCs), providing a cleaner and more intuitive way to define components.

For more details about using `<script setup>`, refer to the [Vue 3 Script Setup Docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup).

## Getting Started

To learn more about setting up and configuring your Vue 3 + TypeScript project, check out the [Vue TypeScript Guide](https://vuejs.org/guide/typescript/overview.html#project-setup) for best practices, IDE support, and configuration tips.
